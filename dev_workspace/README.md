# Developer Workspace

This folder is specifically for active contributors to the source code who'd like a playground where they can easily share source code with other members of the team, test things out, etc.

If you're not an active contributor to the project, feel free to completely ignore this folder at no loss.

This is basically the Wild Wild West of the codebase.

Code here doesn't have to follow any specific rules, whether development-related or stylistic.

Eventually, this folder may be removed entirely upon unanimous consensus from the team.
